# Stallions-ADI

In this project, we clean a dataset containing YouTube statistics for US-based users. We then perform hypothesis testing on the cleaned dataset. 

There are two jupyter notebooks, the dataset before cleaning, the dataset after cleaning and the presentation.

The dataset we chose was USvideos_modified1.csv from Kaggle. For convenience I have renamed this csv file to Before_Cleaning.csv and After_Cleaning.csv for the uncleaned and cleaned dataset respectively.
